**--Lukas Wong Weather webapp--**

**Created:**    08/20/2023

**Purpose:**    This Weather Dashboard was created by Lukas Wong as a demonstration of fetching real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap's API, and for understanding API endpoints.

**What it does:**   It displays current conditions, forecasts, and allows searching for cities to view their weather information.

**How it was bult:**    The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The OpenWeatherMap API provides the weather data, which is fetched and displayed dynamically on this page.

**How it's deployed:**  This app was deployed using AWS Amplify, a cloud service that simplifies the process of deploying and hosting web applications. The deployment process involved connecting a code repository, configuring build settings, and deploying the app to a domain provided by AWS Amplify.

**NOTE:**
The OpenWeatherMap API has been redacted, in order to make it work you must replace it with your own in the weatherApp.js file
