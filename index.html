        <h2>How/why this web app was created</h2>
        <p>
            This Weather Dashboard was created by Lukas Wong as a demonstration of fetching real-time weather data
            using OpenWeatherMap's API, and for understanding API endpoints. It displays current conditions, forecasts, and allows searching
            for cities to view their weather information.
        </p>
        <p>
            The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The OpenWeatherMap API provides the
            weather data, which is fetched and displayed dynamically on this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            This app was deployed using AWS Amplify, a cloud service that simplifies the process of
            deploying and hosting web applications. The deployment process involved connecting a code
            repository, configuring build settings, and deploying the app to a domain provided by AWS Amplify.
